\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

The current modelâ€™s poor performance highlights the need for further refinement, particularly in feature selection,
model choice, and hyperparameter tuning. To enhance predictive accuracy, future efforts should focus on exploring
additional data transformations, trying alternative regression models like XGBoost or deep learning, and utilizing
more advanced optimization techniques such as Bayesian search. Additionally, error analysis and data augmentation
may help mitigate inconsistencies and improve model generalization. By iterating on these improvements, model
could become more reliable for Bitcoin price forecasting.
