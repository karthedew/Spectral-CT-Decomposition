\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

The model's performance indicates significant predictive errors, with a high Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), alongside a negative RÂ² score. These results suggest that the
model fails to capture meaningful relationships in the data, potentially due to feature limitations,
inadequate hyperparameter tuning, or underlying data inconsistencies. The complexity of Bitcoin
price prediction, influenced by various macroeconomic and sentiment-driven factors, may require a
more sophisticated modeling approach. Incorporating additional features, such as global financial
indicators or real-time sentiment analysis, could improve prediction accuracy.
