Several studies have explored Bitcoin price prediction using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
Chen (2023)\ \cite{Chen2023} investigated various machine learning models for Bitcoin price forecasting,
emphasizing their effectiveness in financial risk management. Ji et al. (2019) conducted a comparative study
of deep learning approaches, demonstrating the advantages of neural networks over traditional models in capturing
complex market patterns. Similarly, Chen et al. (2020)\ \cite{Chen2020} proposed a novel method for sample
dimension engineering to enhance the performance of machine learning models in Bitcoin price prediction,
highlighting the impact of data preprocessing on forecasting accuracy. These studies collectively contribute
to the growing body of research on cryptocurrency price prediction, showcasing different methodologies to improve
predictive accuracy.
