\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Bitcoin has garnered popular and traditional finance support through recent years. Since its initial proposal in 2008,
it has proven to be a volatile asset that cycles peaks and lows over a four year cycle. It should be noted that,
in order to build a likely significantly more accurate model, several various methods should be analyzed which includes
additional machine learning models beyond the regressive or classification models taught within this course.
Additionally, quality and complete cycle data should be used to fully train models if the intent is to use them in
actual trading. As such, it should be noted that this is a simple project intended to learn supervised learning methods
and should not be taken as financial advice. It is likely that the model developed in this report will be far from
worthy for making any sort of Bitcoin investment decisions.
